# [Pokemon Competitiveness Assessment: Project Overview](https://github.com/ChrisMaringka/Pokemon-Gen-1to8)
* Cleaned dataset based on .csv file using Jupyter Notebook
* Conducted statistical analysis to determine the difference in competitiveness between each generations of Pokemon. From ANOVA testing, I concluded that the spread of overall status between Pokemon in each generation is well-balanced.
* Performed statistical analysis to assess the difference between single-type Pokemon against dual-type Pokemon. Through the testing, dual-type pokemon has significantly higher overall status compared to single-type Pokemon. This finding demonstrated that most dual-type Pokemon make up their 4x weakness against certain elements through a higher overall status.
* Created dashboard using Tableau to visualize Pokemon based on their competitiveness, type, and generation. This helps me to create a Pokemon team based on its competitiveness and type.

# [FIFA 2022 Analytics: Project Overview](https://github.com/ChrisMaringka/FIFA-2022)
* Conducted exploratory analysis using FIFA 2022 player data sets
* Created dashboard using Tableau to visualize player ratings based on the league, clubs, and country. Typically I use this to find certain players in FIFA to build team chemistry or open a new pack.

# [Ecuador Supermarket Prediction: Project Overview](https://github.com/ChrisMaringka/Ecuador)
* Created Linear Regression to assess the effect of oil price and holiday to sales in Supermarket. At the moment I concluded holiday effect and oil price do not significantly impact customer spending in various segments.
